This allows for deploying YOLOv8 models in C++ environments for efficient execution.\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Dependencies\n\nEnsure you have the following dependencies installed before proceeding:\n\n| Dependency   | Version  | Resource                                     |\n| :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------- |\n| OpenCV       | >=4.0.0  | [https://opencv.org/](https://opencv.org/)   |\n| C++ Standard | >=17     | [https://isocpp.org/](https://isocpp.org/)   |\n| CMake        | >=3.18   | [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)     |\n| Libtorch     | >=1.12.1 | [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) |\n\nYou can download the required version of LibTorch from the official [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) website.

For example, to export the `yolov8s.pt` model with an input image size of 640x640:\n\n```bash\nyolo export model=yolov8s.pt imgsz=640 format=torchscript\n```\n\nThis command will generate a `yolov8s.torchscript` file in the model's directory. This file contains the serialized model that can be loaded and executed by the C++ application using LibTorch.

YOLOv8 models are provided under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/LICENSE) and [Enterprise](https://www.ultralytics.com/license) licenses.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is YOLOv8 and how does it differ from previous YOLO versions?\n\nYOLOv8 is designed to improve real-time object detection performance with advanced features. Unlike earlier versions, YOLOv8 incorporates an **anchor-free split Ultralytics head**, state-of-the-art [backbone](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/backbone) and neck architectures, and offers optimized [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy)-speed tradeoff, making it ideal for diverse applications. For more details, check the [Overview](#overview) and [Key Features](#key-features-of-yolov8) sections.\n\n### How can I use YOLOv8 for different computer vision tasks?\n\nYOLOv8 supports a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints detection, oriented object detection, and classification. Each model variant is optimized for its specific task and compatible with various operational modes like [Inference](../modes/predict.md), [Validation](../modes/val.md), [Training](../modes/train.md), and [Export](../modes/export.md). Refer to the [Supported Tasks and Modes](#supported-tasks-and-modes) section for more information.\n\n### What are the performance metrics for YOLOv8 models?\n\nYOLOv8 models achieve state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarking datasets. For instance, the YOLOv8n model achieves a mAP (mean Average Precision) of 37.3 on the COCO dataset and a speed of 0.99 ms on A100 TensorRT. Detailed performance metrics for each model variant across different tasks and datasets can be found in the [Performance Metrics](#performance-metrics) section.\n\n### How do I train a YOLOv8 model?\n\nTraining a YOLOv8 model can be done using either Python or CLI.
