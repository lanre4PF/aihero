Originating from the foundational architecture of the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model developed by Ultralytics, YOLOv5u integrates the anchor-free, objectness-free split head, a feature previously introduced in the [YOLOv8](yolov8.md) models. This adaptation refines the model's architecture, leading to an improved accuracy-speed tradeoff in object detection tasks. Given the empirical results and its derived features, YOLOv5u provides an efficient alternative for those seeking robust solutions in both research and practical applications.\n\n![Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/ultralytics-yolov5-splash.avif)\n\n!!! warning \"YOLOv5 models trained by [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) are not compatible with [ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) library\"\n\n    Ultralytics provides an [anchor-free variant of YOLOv5 model](#performance-metrics). Models trained with the [original YOLOv5 repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) cannot be used with the Ultralytics library.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Anchor-free Split Ultralytics Head:** Traditional object detection models rely on predefined anchor boxes to predict object locations. However, YOLOv5u modernizes this approach. By adopting an anchor-free split Ultralytics head, it ensures a more flexible and adaptive detection mechanism, consequently enhancing the performance in diverse scenarios.\n\n- **Optimized Accuracy-Speed Tradeoff:** Speed and accuracy often pull in opposite directions. But YOLOv5u challenges this tradeoff. It offers a calibrated balance, ensuring real-time detections without compromising on accuracy. This feature is particularly invaluable for applications that demand swift responses, such as [autonomous vehicles](https://www.ultralyti",
