You've diligently collected data, meticulously annotated it, and put in the hours to train and rigorously evaluate your custom YOLO11 model. Now, it's time to put your model to work for your specific application, use case, or project. But there's a critical decision that stands before you: how to export and deploy your model effectively.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <br>\n  <iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkCsj2SvZc4\"\n    title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n    allowfullscreen>\n  </iframe>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Watch:</strong> How to Choose the Best Ultralytics YOLO11 Deployment Format for Your Project | TensorRT | OpenVINO \ud83d\ude80\n</p>\n\nThis guide walks you through YOLO11's deployment options and the essential factors to consider to choose the right option for your project.\n\n## How to Select the Right Deployment Option for Your YOLO11 Model\n\nWhen it's time to deploy your YOLO11 model, selecting a suitable export format is very important. As outlined in the [Ultralytics YOLO11 Modes documentation](../modes/export.md#usage-examples), the model.export() function allows for converting your trained model into a variety of formats tailored to diverse environments and performance requirements.\n\nThe ideal format depends on your model's intended operational context, balancing speed, hardware constraints, and ease of integration. In the following section, we'll take a closer look at each export option, understanding when to choose each one.\n\n## YOLO11's Deployment Options\n\nLet's walk through the different YOLO11 deployment options.
