Model evaluation involves metrics and plots to assess the model's accuracy. On the other hand, model testing checks if the model's learned behavior is the same as expectations. In this guide, we'll explore strategies for testing your [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) models.\n\n## Model Testing Vs. Model Evaluation\n\nFirst, let's understand the difference between model evaluation and testing with an example.\n\nSuppose you have trained a computer vision model to recognize cats and dogs, and you want to deploy this model at a pet store to monitor the animals. During the model evaluation phase, you use a labeled dataset to calculate metrics like accuracy, [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision), [recall](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recall), and F1 score. For instance, the model might have an accuracy of 98% in distinguishing between cats and dogs in a given dataset.\n\nAfter evaluation, you test the model using images from a pet store to see how well it identifies cats and dogs in more varied and realistic conditions. You check if it can correctly label cats and dogs when they are moving, in different lighting conditions, or partially obscured by objects like toys or furniture. Model testing checks that the model behaves as expected outside the controlled evaluation environment.\n\n## Preparing for Model Testing\n\nComputer vision models learn from datasets by detecting patterns, making predictions, and evaluating their performance. These [datasets](./preprocessing_annotated_data.md) are usually divided into training and testing sets to simulate real-world conditions. [Training data](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/training-data) teaches the model while testing data verifies its accuracy.\n\nHere are two points to keep in mind before testing your model:\n\n- **Realistic Repr",

These help you spot specific areas where the model might not be performing well in practical applications.\n\nNext, the testing results can be analyzed:\n\n- **Misclassified Images:** Identify and review images that the model misclassified to understand where it is going wrong.\n- **Error Analysis:** Perform a thorough error analysis to understand the types of errors (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives) and their potential causes.\n- **Bias and Fairness:** Check for any biases in the model's predictions. Ensure that the model performs equally well across different subsets of the data, especially if it includes sensitive attributes like race, gender, or age.\n\n## Testing Your YOLO11 Model\n\nTo test your YOLO11 model, you can use the validation mode. It's a straightforward way to understand the model's strengths and areas that need improvement. Also, you'll need to format your test dataset correctly for YOLO11. For more details on how to use the validation mode, check out the [Model Validation](../modes/val.md) docs page.\n\n## Using YOLO11 to Predict on Multiple Test Images\n\nIf you want to test your trained YOLO11 model on multiple images stored in a folder, you can easily do so in one go. Instead of using the validation mode, which is typically used to evaluate model performance on a validation set and provide detailed metrics, you might just want to see predictions on all images in your test set. For this, you can use the [prediction mode](../modes/predict.md).\n\n### Difference Between Validation and Prediction Modes\n\n- **[Validation Mode](../modes/val.md):** Used to evaluate the model's performance by comparing predictions against known labels (ground truth). It provides detailed metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n- **[Prediction Mode](../modes/predict.md):** Used to run the model on new, unseen data to generate predictions. It does not provide detailed performance metrics but allows you to see how the model performs on real-world images.\n\n#",
