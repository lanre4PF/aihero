Performance numbers shown here are **previews only**.\n    Final downloads and releases will follow soon \u2014 stay updated via [YOLO Vision 2025](https://www.ultralytics.com/events/yolovision).\n\n## Overview\n\n[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) YOLO26 is the latest evolution in the YOLO series of real-time object detectors, engineered from the ground up for **edge and low-power devices**. It introduces a streamlined design that removes unnecessary complexity while integrating targeted innovations to deliver faster, lighter, and more accessible deployment.\n\nThe architecture of YOLO26 is guided by three core principles:\n\n- **Simplicity:** YOLO26 is a **native end-to-end model**, producing predictions directly without the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS). By eliminating this post-processing step, inference becomes faster, lighter, and easier to deploy in real-world systems. This breakthrough approach was first pioneered in [YOLOv10](../models/yolov10.md) by Ao Wang at Tsinghua University and has been further advanced in YOLO26.\n- **Deployment Efficiency:** The end-to-end design cuts out an entire stage of the pipeline, dramatically simplifying integration, reducing latency, and making deployment more robust across diverse environments.\n- **Training Innovation:** YOLO26 introduces the **MuSGD optimizer**, a hybrid of [SGD](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html) and [Muon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982) \u2014 inspired by Moonshot AI's [Kimi K2](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/) breakthroughs in LLM training. This optimizer brings enhanced stability and faster convergence, transferring optimization advances from language models into computer vision.\n\nTogether, these innovations deliver a model family that achieves higher accuracy on small objects, provides seamless deployment, and runs **up to 43% faster on CPUs** \u2014 making ",
