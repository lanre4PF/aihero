By integrating Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and reversible functions, YOLOv9 ensures essential data retention, enhancing the model's accuracy and efficiency. This makes it highly suitable for applications requiring compact models with high performance. For more details, explore the section on [YOLOv9's impact on lightweight models](#impact-on-lightweight-models).\n\n### What tasks and modes does YOLOv9 support?\n\nYOLOv9 supports various tasks including object detection and [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation). It is compatible with multiple operational modes such as inference, validation, training, and export. This versatility makes YOLOv9 adaptable to diverse real-time computer vision applications.

For a detailed explanation, see the [Consistent Dual Assignments for NMS-Free Training](#consistent-dual-assignments-for-nms-free-training) section.\n\n### Where can I find the export options for YOLOv10 models?\n\nYOLOv10 supports several export formats, including TorchScript, ONNX, OpenVINO, and TensorRT. However, not all export formats provided by Ultralytics are currently supported for YOLOv10 due to its new operations. For details on the supported formats and instructions on exporting, visit the [Exporting YOLOv10](#exporting-yolov10) section.\n\n### What are the performance benchmarks for YOLOv10 models?\n\nYOLOv10 outperforms previous YOLO versions and other state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and efficiency. For example, YOLOv10s is 1.8x faster than RT-DETR-R18 with a similar AP on the COCO dataset. YOLOv10b shows 46% less latency and 25% fewer parameters than YOLOv9-C with the same performance.

It surpasses other models, such as YOLOX, YOLOv5, and PPYOLOE, in both parameters usage and inference speed. YOLOv7's distinguishing features include its model re-parameterization and dynamic label assignment, which optimize its performance without increasing inference costs. For more technical details about its architecture and comparison metrics with other state-of-the-art object detectors, refer to the [YOLOv7 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02696).\n\n### How does YOLOv7 improve on previous YOLO models like YOLOv4 and YOLOv5?\n\nYOLOv7 introduces several innovations, including model re-parameterization and dynamic label assignment, which enhance the training process and improve inference accuracy. Compared to YOLOv5, YOLOv7 significantly boosts speed and accuracy. For instance, YOLOv7-X improves accuracy by 2.2% and reduces parameters by 22% compared to YOLOv5-X. Detailed comparisons can be found in the performance table [YOLOv7 comparison with SOTA object detectors](#comparison-of-sota-object-detectors).\n\n### Can I use YOLOv7 with Ultralytics tools and platforms?\n\nAs of now, Ultralytics only supports YOLOv7 ONNX and TensorRT inference. To run the ONNX and TensorRT exported version of YOLOv7 with Ultralytics, check the [Usage Examples](#usage-examples) section.\n\n### How do I train a custom YOLOv7 model using my dataset?\n\nTo install and train a custom YOLOv7 model, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the YOLOv7 repository:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7\n    ```\n2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install dependencies:\n    ```bash\n    cd yolov7\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n3.
