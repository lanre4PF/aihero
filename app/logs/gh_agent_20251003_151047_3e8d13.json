This allows you to continue the training process seamlessly from where it was left off.\n\nYou can easily resume training in Ultralytics YOLO by setting the `resume` argument to `True` when calling the `train` method, and specifying the path to the `.pt` file containing the partially trained model weights.\n\nBelow is an example of how to resume an interrupted training using Python and via the command line:\n\n!!! example \"Resume Training Example\"\n\n    === \"Python\"\n\n        ```python\n        from ultralytics import YOLO\n\n        # Load a model\n        model = YOLO(\"path/to/last.pt\")  # load a partially trained model\n\n        # Resume training\n        results = model.train(resume=True)\n        ```\n\n    === \"CLI\"\n\n        ```bash\n        # Resume an interrupted training\n        yolo train resume model=path/to/last.pt\n        ```\n\nBy setting `resume=True`, the `train` function will continue training from where it left off, using the state stored in the 'path/to/last.pt' file.
