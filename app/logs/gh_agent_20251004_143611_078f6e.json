This dramatically accelerates training, particularly when dataset I/O (Input/Output) operations are a bottleneck. Note that this requires substantial RAM or disk space.\n\n!!! tip \"Local Data Storage\"\n\n    \ud83d\udca1 Always train using datasets stored locally. Accessing data from network drives (like Google Drive) or remote storage can be significantly slower and impede training performance. Copying your dataset to a local SSD is often the best practice.\n\nAll training outputs, including weights and logs, are saved in the `runs/train/` directory. Each training session creates a new subdirectory (e.g., `runs/train/exp`, `runs/train/exp2`, etc.).

By integrating Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and reversible functions, YOLOv9 ensures essential data retention, enhancing the model's accuracy and efficiency. This makes it highly suitable for applications requiring compact models with high performance. For more details, explore the section on [YOLOv9's impact on lightweight models](#impact-on-lightweight-models).\n\n### What tasks and modes does YOLOv9 support?\n\nYOLOv9 supports various tasks including object detection and [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation). It is compatible with multiple operational modes such as inference, validation, training, and export. This versatility makes YOLOv9 adaptable to diverse real-time computer vision applications.

The available resources cover **YOLOv5**, **YOLOv8**, **YOLOv9**, and **YOLOE**.\n\nGenerally, to train a YOLO model with Ultralytics, you would use the `YOLO()` class in Python or the `yolo` command-line interface (CLI). The process typically involves:\n\n1.  **Loading a model:** You would specify a pre-trained model (e.g., `yolov8n.pt` for YOLOv8 nano) or a configuration file (e.g., `yolov9c.yaml` for YOLOv9 compact).\n2.  **Preparing your dataset:** This usually involves having a `data.yaml` file that defines the paths to your training and validation images and labels, as well as the class names.\n3.  **Calling the `train` method:** You would pass parameters like the dataset path (`data`), number of epochs (`epochs`), and image size (`imgsz`).\n\nHere's a general example for **YOLOv8** in Python, which might give you an idea of the typical training workflow:\n\n```python\nfrom ultralytics import YOLO\n\n# Load a COCO-pretrained YOLOv8n model\nmodel = YOLO(\"yolov8n.pt\")\n\n# Train the model on your custom dataset for 100 epochs\nresults = model.train(data=\"your_dataset.yaml\", epochs=100, imgsz=640)\n```\n\nAnd in the CLI:\n\n```bash\nyolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=your_dataset.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640\n```\n\nYou can find more details on training different YOLO versions in these documents:\n\n*   [Train Custom Data (YOLOv5)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/train_custom_data.md)\n*   [YOLOv8 Documentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/yolov8.md)\n*   [YOLOv9 Documentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/yolov9.md)\n*   [YOLOE Train Reference](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/models/yolo/yoloe/train.py)\n\nIf YOLOv11 is a new or unreleased model, it's possible the documentation has not yet been updated.
